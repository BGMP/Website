# Website

The Website for the Re-Volt America Community.

## Running
Software you will need in order to run the website.

  * [Ruby 2.6.6](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).
      * Windows: [Ruby Installer](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) is recommended. Default options should do fine.
      * OS X: [RVM](http://rvm.io) is recommended over the default OS X Ruby.
       Here's a one-liner: `\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby`.
       
## Set Up
Instructions on how to set the website up for development purposes.

  * Ensure bundler is installed: `gem install bundle`.
  * Run `bundle install` from the project root to download and install dependencies.
  * Also from the project root, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to serve your website with Jekyll.
  * Open your browser and preview the website at `localhost:4000`.
